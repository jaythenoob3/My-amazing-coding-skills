Personal Expense Tracker

This is my first Java project  
It’s a simple console program where you type in how much money you make each month and then your top 5 expenses.  
The program adds them up and shows you how much you spend and how much you have left at the end of the month.

How to Run
1. Download the file `PersonalExpenseTracker.java`
2. Compile it
3. Run it

Why I made it
I wanted to practice Java basics like Scanner, variables, math, and printing results.  
It’s nothing crazy but it works and I am going to add some loops, put it in GUI, and maybe add saving data 
so stick around because part 2 is coming on github soon near you.

                                                    Update 1 verison
                                              -----------------------------
The update 1 verison lets you add  unlimited expenses instead of being limited to 5. Uses loops to handle input dynamically reducing repeated code.
Stores expenses in ArrayLists for easier calculations and scalability. Calculates total, average, and remaining balance automatically.
